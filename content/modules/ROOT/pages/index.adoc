= Lab Introduction

== About this Lab

You have already used Ansible Automation quite a bit and have started to look into Ansible Automation Platform automation controller? Or you are already using automation controller (fka Tower)? Cool.
We prepared this lab to give you a hands-on introduction to some of the more advanced features of the automation controller. You’ll learn to:

- Automate the automation: Configure automation controller with Ansible.
- Use controller workflows to allow teams to work more efficiently together.
- Use surveys to provide self-service to your automation users.
- Use dynamic inventories and the new constructed inventory feature for scale and flexibility.
- Secure the automation supply chain: Use content signing to make sure only approved content is run in automation controller.


== Lab Infrastructure

Your lab includes a number of servers:

- A bastion host running VS Code server.
- An automation platform cluster with a separate DB host.
- Two managed RHEL 9 hosts.

TIP: All access information has been summarized for your convenience on page link:lab-access.html[Lab Access], accessible in the TOC to the right.

== Working the Lab

Some hints to get you started:

- Don’t type everything manually, use copy & paste from the browser when appropriate, but take your time to understand what you are actually doing.
- To **edit files** or **open a terminal window**, we provide **VS Code Server**, basically the great VS Code Editor running in your browser.

TIP: Commands you are supposed to run can be shown with or without the expected output

TIP: The command line can wrap on the HTML page from time to time. Therefore the output might be separated from the command line for better readability by an empty line.

== Accessing your Lab Environment

=== Using VS Code

Your main point of contact with the lab is **VS Code Server**, providing a VS Code-experience in your browser. You'll use VS Code to open terminals and to edit files (either in the build-in GUI editor or just using your favorite editor on the command line). 

Now, open **VS Code** by clicking on the URL {vscode_web_ui_url}[window=_blank].

You should be greeted with a login screen:

image::vscode-pwd.png[500,300]

Use the password **{vscode_web_ui_password}** to log in to the **VS Code** server web UI. Now open a new terminal by heading to the menu item **Terminal** at the top of the page and select **New Terminal**. A new section will appear in the lower half of the screen and you will be greeted with a prompt:

Congrats, you now have a shell terminal on your bastion node you can use to work on the command line. From here you run commands or access the other hosts in your lab environment, if the lab task requires it.

=== OPTIONAL: Direct Lab Access using SSH

You can of course use SSH directly to access the bastion node when you have an SSH client ready to go and know your way around:

[subs="attributes",source,shell,role=execute]
----
ssh lab-user@{bastion_host_name}
----

The password is still the same: {ansible_controller_admin_password}

TIP: The user to access the terminal is `lab-user`, but your bastion node is setup to let you become `root` using _sudo_ without a password.

TIP: All access information has been summarized for your convenience under xref:lab-access.adoc[Lab Access], accessible in the navigation menu to the right.

== Lab Configuration

Most prerequisite tasks have already been done for you:

- Ansible software is installed
- `sudo` has been configured on the managed hosts to run commands that require root privileges.
- An `.ansible-navigator.yml` configuration file has been created.
Without it, you would have to add parameters to each execution of `ansible-navigator`.

== Brief Introduction to `ansible-navigator`

During this lab, you will always use `ansible-navigator` which supersedes the capabilities of `ansible-playbook`. Let's check Ansible Navigator has been installed correctly (your browser might ask for permission for pasting):

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
ansible-navigator --version
----

where the result should be something like (your actual version might differ):
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator 3.4.1
----

Have now a look at your Ansible Navigator configuration file. It's a dot file in your user's home directory and can be printed to screen with the following command:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
cat ~/.ansible-navigator.yml
----

You can also open the file in VS Code by using the navigation bar on the left or the "Open File" command from the "File" menu.

Note the following parameters within the `execution-environment` section:

- `image`: where the default execution environment is set, we have switched it to your **private automation hub**
- `pull.policy`: set to **missing**, only download the execution environment if it doesn't already exist locally.
- `environment-variables`: since execution environments are basically Linux containers, which don't have access to your environment variables, we have to compile a list of variables we want to have passed through to the container, or even specifically defined.

For a full listing of every configurable knob checkout the link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/[settings documentation,window=_blank].

NOTE: For your convenience we added the authentication credentials for automation controller to the configuration, so you don't have to manually log in. In most real world scenarios you probably don't want to do this and will not store your password in a clear text configuration file

Run the `ansible-navigator` command with the `images` argument to look at execution environments configured on the control node:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
ansible-navigator images
----

image::navigator-images.png[]

NOTE: The output you see might differ from the above output, but you should see at least the one image configured in the file.

This command gives you information about all currently installed Execution Environments or EEs for short. Investigate an EE by pressing the corresponding number. For example pressing **0** with the above example will open the `ee-supported-rhel8` execution environment:

image::navigator-ee-menu.png[]

Selecting **2** for `Ansible version and collections` will show us all Ansible Collections installed on that particular EE, and the version of `ansible-core`:

image::navigator-ee-collections.png[]

To get back to the preceding view in `ansible-navigator` press **Esc**, if needed several times.
The last press in the main menu will get you out of Navigator.
Alternatively you can type **:q** anywhere to exit at once (familiar with Vi?).
