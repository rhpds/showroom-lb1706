# Configure automation controller resources with Ansible

This is an advanced automation controller lab, so we donâ€™t really want you to use the web UI for everything. To fully embrace automation and adopt the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code[infrastructure as code,window=_blank] methodology, **we want to use Ansible to configure our automation controller** cluster.

Since automation controller is exposing all of its functionality via REST API, we can automate everything.
Instead of using the API directly, it is highly recommended to use the https://github.com/ansible/awx/tree/devel/awx_collection[AWX,window=_blank] or https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/controller[automation controller,window=_blank] Ansible Collection (the second link will only work for you if you have an active Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Subscription) to setup, configure and maintain your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform automation controller using Ansible.

== The Scenario

For the next chapters we need a number of resources configured in automation controller:

- Static **Inventory** with two hosts
- **Credentials**
- Two **Projects**
- Two **Job Templates**

This would involve a lot of error prone clicking in the web UI, so you'll use the pro way: a playbook was prepared upfront to save time, but you will still learn how to use Ansible to configure automation controller.

== Authentication

The Ansible modules we use in the playbook need to talk to automation controller and require authentication, of course. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, you could e.g. set the URL/user name/password as environment variables.

In this lab we use a little trick to save time and make it less error prone.
We set the credentials and other values directly in the `.ansible-navigator.yml` file in your home directory, so `ansible-navigator` will pick them up with every run.
Have a look for yourself in your terminal on the bastion host:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
cat ~/.ansible-navigator.yml
----

The result should look like this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    image: "{private_automation_hub_url}/ee-supported-rhel8:latest"
    enabled: true
    container-engine: podman
    pull:
      policy: missing
    volume-mounts:
       - {dest: /etc/ansible/, src: /etc/ansible/}
    environment-variables:
      pass:
        - GUID
      set:
        CONTROLLER_HOST: "{ansible_controller_web_ui_url}"
        CONTROLLER_USERNAME: "{ansible_controller_admin_username}"
        CONTROLLER_PASSWORD: "{ansible_controller_admin_password}"
        CONTROLLER_VERIFY_SSL: "True"
----

The env variables prefixed with `CONTROLLER_` are the connection and credential parameters.

NOTE: For your convenience we added the authentication credentials for automation controller to the configuration, so you don't have to manually log in. In most real world scenarios you probably don't want to do this and will not store your password in a clear text configuration file.

TIP: for performance and security reasons, it is recommended "in real life" to generate and use a token for your automation.
Check the referenced documentation for details on how to do this.

== Create the Playbook

Now, let's get the Playbook. In your VS Code terminal (or SSH session) run:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone {gitea_web_ui_url}/lab-user/playbooks-adv-controller.git
cd playbooks-adv-controller
cat configure-controller.yml
----

Use `cat` or the VS Code editor to have a good look at what the `configure-controller.yml` Playbook is supposed to do.

Since we are calling the REST API of automation controller, the Ansible playbook is run against **localhost**, but the modules will connect to the URL provided by the **CONTROLLER_HOST** environment variable set for you in `~/.ansible-navigator.yml`.

Tasks:

* **Create an inventory**: An inventory is created.
* **Add hosts to inventory**: Hosts are added to the inventory.
* **Machine Credentials**: Machine credentials are created.
+
TIP: SSH keys have already been created and distributed in your lab environment and `sudo` has been setup on the managed hosts to allow password-less login. When you SSH into a host as a regular user from the bastion node you will become user **ec2-user** on the host you logged in.

* **Lab Project**: A Project is created, the content used in this lab is hosted on GitLab in the project https://gitlab.com/ansible-labs-crew/playbooks-adv-controller[https://gitlab.com/ansible-labs-crew/playbooks-adv-controller,window=_blank].

NOTE: SSH keys have already been created and distributed in your lab environment and `sudo` has been setup on the managed hosts to allow password-less login. When you SSH into a host as user a regular user from bastion node you will become user **ec2-user** on the host you logged in.

=== Run the Playbook

After you have inspected the Playbook finally run it:

[source,shell,role=execute]
----
ansible-navigator run configure-controller.yml
----

While in `ansible-navigator` press a line number e.g. to get more information about a play or tasks. Note: this works only for less then 10 lines, if you have more, you need to press `:` first.
To leave press `Esc` multiple times to get up again in the views and eventually out of Navigator (**but** wait until the playbook is marked as successful before you do that!).

After the successful run, log into your {ansible_controller_web_ui_url}[automation controller web UI,window=_blank], using the user *{ansible_controller_admin_username}* and the usual password *{ansible_controller_admin_password}*.
Make sure that you see the configured objects and a job "Source Control Update" to synchronize the Git project.

TIP: If you run this Ansible Playbook multiple times, you will notice the **ansible.controller.credential** module is not idempotent! Since automation controller stores the SSH key encrypted, the Ansible Module is unable to verify it has already been set and didn't change. This is what we want and expect from a secure system, but it also means Ansible has no means to verify it and hence overrides the SSH key or password every time the Ansible Playbook is executed.
This can be overridden with the `update_secrets` parameter.
Also note that the `credential_type` value is simply the type's name.
